 Find the best advanced classes for each character

## Goals

1. Normalize the data
2. Find correlation between base stat growth rate and advanced class growth rate
3. For each class, rank the top 5 characters by correlation


## What does the data mean?

A high correlation between a character's base stat growth rate and a class's growth rate indicates a class favors a character's strengths when leveling up. So if a player wanted to get the most out of a specific character, using the listed classes are a solid option.

A character with relatively low correlations for each class indicates they may be fine the way they are, better off with a character-specific class ... or they're highly specialized in a few areas. 

However, we're only looking at stats here. Other factors such as playstyle, class/character bonuses, Emblem Rings, etc. likely hold just as much weight (if not more).
